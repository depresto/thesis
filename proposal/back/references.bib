  abstract = {Dynamic ride-share systems aim to bring together travelers with similar itineraries and time schedules on short-notice. These systems may provide significant societal and environmental benefits by reducing the number of cars used for personal travel and improving the utilization of available seat capacity. Effective and efficient optimization technology that matches drivers and riders in real-time is one of the necessary components for a successful dynamic ride-share system. We systematically outline the optimization challenges that arise when developing technology to support ride-sharing and survey the related operations research models in the academic literature. We hope that this paper will encourage more research by the transportation science and logistics community in this exciting, emerging area of public transportation.},

  abstract = {Ridesharing concerns people that are willing to intelligently ride in order to save money and protect environment. The idea is based on a better use of private car. More precisely, it aims to bring together individuals that share, even partially, a trip. In the recurring ridesharing problem, when an offer is matched with a demand, the driver picks-up the rider at his starting location, drops him off at his ending location and continues to his target location. This approach lacks of flexibility and misses some possible matchings. In this paper, we propose a new ridesharing approach in which a driver and a rider accept to meet in an intermediate starting location and to separate in another intermediate ending location. This allows to reduce both the driver's detour and the total travel cost. We propose exact and heuristic methods to compute meeting points that minimize the total travel cost of the driver and the rider. We analyze their empirical performance on a set of real road networks consisting of up to 3,5 million nodes and 8,7 million edges. Our experimental analysis shows that our heuristics provide efficient performances within short CPU times and improves the recurring ridesharing approach.},

  abstract = {Ridesharing as a mode of travel is a potential solution to a variety of the transportation sectors 45 toughest challenges including congestion relief, increased energy security, reduced GHG emissions and improved travel options. However, the transportation literature provides little quantified assessment of ridesharing's overall potential. This paper proposes a data driven methodology for estimating the viability of ridesharing at an organizational scale, and seeks to demonstrate its applicability using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology commuting 50 population as a case. The methodology seeks to improve upon previous research by differentiating between modeled rideshare potential based on known trip characteristics, and observed rideshare behavior, within the same commuting population. By comparing rideshare potential to observed behavior, inferences can be made about the relative importance of trip characteristics vs. the importance of 55 human attitudes in rideshare arrangements. MIT-specific results suggest that between 50\% and 77\% of the commuting population could rideshare on a maximum-effort day. These are values significantly higher than the 8\% of the MIT community that currently choose to rideshare. Maximum achievable VMT reductions from daily ridesharing are between 9\% and 27\%. 60 The disparity between the modeled potential and observed behavior suggests that human attitudes are a much larger barrier to increased rideshare participation than incompatible trip characteristics. The results suggest that policy makers seeking to increase rideshare participation may want to target large organizations and focus their efforts on personalized travel planning in an effort to improve attitudes towards ridesharing. 65 Amey, A.; 2011 TRB Annual Meeting 3},

  abstract = {Car pooling is a transportation service organized by a large company which encourages its employees to pick up colleagues while driving to/from work to minimize the number of private cars travelling to/from the company site. The car pooling problem consists of defining the subsets of employees that will share each car and the paths the drivers should follow, so that sharing is maximized and the sum of the path costs is minimized. The special case of the car pooling problem where all cars are identical can be modeled as a Dial-a-Ride Problem. In this paper, we propose both an exact and a heuristic method for the car pooling problem, based on two integer programming formulations of the problem. The exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the problem. A valid upper bound is obtained by the heuristic method, which transforms the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution. The computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Taxicabs play an important role in urban public transportation. Analyzing taxi traffic of Shanghai, San Francisco, and New York City, we have found that the short trips within city are mostly of commuters during office hours and span a specific city area. Now, if the large number of commuters are ready to share their rides, that will have a huge impact on the `super-commute' problem faced in various cities of USA and around the world. While ride-sharing can increase taxi occupancy and profit for drivers and savings for passengers, it reduces the overall on-road traffic and thereby the average commute time and carbon foot-print. While centralized ride-sharing services, like car-pooling, can address the problem to some extent, they lack scalability and power to dynamically adapt the taxi schedule for best results. In this paper, we propose a four-way model for the ride-sharing problem and develop a novel distributed taxi ride sharing (TRS) algorithm to address dynamic scheduling of ride sharing requests. Our algorithm shows the overall reduction in total distance travelled by taxis as a result of ride sharing. Empirical results using large scale taxi GPS traces from Shanghai, China show that TRS algorithm can grossly outperform a Taxi Distance Minimization (TDM) algorithm. TRS accommodates 33\% higher ride share among passengers while dealing with 44,241 requests handled by 4,000 taxis on a single day in Shanghai.},

Different objectives are discussed taking into account the roles played by the actors involved in the decision process, i.e., carriers and governmental authorities. Emphasis is in particular given to network design and toll setting in such issues. The network design problem consists in defining either the subnetwork of the entire transportation network onto which hazmat flow can be routed with minimum risk, or the capacities allowed for such a flow on each network arc to achieve the same objective. Network design involves also the successive carrier decision about the minimum cost paths to be used on the designed network. Therefore it is a biobjective problem with two decision makers, and, in the literature, a bilevel optimization approach is often used. Toll setting is a recent topic of research in hazmat transportation: the idea is to use a toll policy to discourage carriers from overloading portions of the network with the consequent increase of the risk exposure on the population involved. Approaches based on bilevel optimization and game theory are discussed and compared.},

  abstract = {Due to its significant economic and environmental impact, sharing the ride among a number of drivers (i.e., Car pooling) has recently gained significant interest from industry and academia. Hence, a number of ride sharing services have appeared along with various algorithms on how to match a rider request to a driver who can provide the ride sharing service. However, existing techniques have several limitations that affect the quality of the ride sharing service, and hence hinder its wide applicability. This paper proposes SHAREK, a scalable and efficient ride sharing service that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches. SHAREK allows riders requesting the ride sharing service to indicate the maximum price they are willing to pay for the service and the maximum waiting time before being picked up. In the mean time, SHAREK computes the price of the service based on the distance of the rider trip and the detour that the driver will make to offer the service. Then, SHAREK returns a set of drivers that can make it to the rider within its price and temporal constraints. Since there could be many of such drivers, SHAREK internally prunes those drivers that are dominated by others, i.e., They provide higher price and higher waiting time than other drivers. To realize its efficiency and scalability, SHAREK employs a set of early pruning techniques that minimize the need for any actual shortest path computations.},

Online ridematching systems are employing a range of new strategies to create ``critical mass'': (1) regional and large employer partnerships, (2) financial incentives, (3) social networking to younger populations, and (4) real-time ridematching services that employ ``smartphones'' and automated ridematching software. Enhanced casual carpooling approaches, which focus on ``meeting places'', are also being explored. Today, ridesharing represents approximately 8\textendash{} 11\% of the transportation modal share in Canada and the USA, respectively. There are approximately 638 ridematching programmes in North America. Ridesharing's evolution can be categorized into five phases: (1) World War II car-sharing (or carpooling) clubs; (2) major responses to the 1970s energy crises; (3) early organized ridesharing schemes; (4) reliable ridesharing systems; and (5) technology-enabled ridematching. While ridesharing's future growth and direction are uncertain, the next decade is likely to include greater interoperability among services, technology integration, and stronger policy support. In light of growing concerns about climate change, congestion, and oil dependency, more research is needed to better understand ridesharing's impacts on infrastructure, congestion, and energy/emissions.},

Given a weighted undirected graph G =  V; E , and a set X   V of terminals, the objective is to nd a tree of minimum cost which connects all the terminals. If the graph is directed, in addition to X, we are given a root r 2 V , and the objective is to nd a minimum cost arborescence which connects the root to each of the terminals. In the Generalized Steiner tree problem, we are given a set X of pairs of vertices, and the goal is to nd a subgraph of minimum cost such that each pair in X is connected. In the undirected case, constant factor algorithms are known for both the versions 11, 14, 17, 1, 15 , but essentially no approximation algorithms were known for these problems in the directed case, other than the trivial O k -approximations. We obtain the rst non-trivial approximation algorithms for both problems in general directed graphs. For the Directed Steiner tree problem, we design a family of algorithms that achieve an approximation ratio of O k   in time  O kn1=   for any xed 0, where k is the number of terminals. For the Directed Generalized Steiner tree problem, we give an algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of  O k2=3 log1=3 k , where k is the number of pairs of vertices that are to be connected. Related problems including the Group Steiner tree problem, the Node Weighted Steiner tree problem and several others can be reduced in an approximation preserving fashion to the problems we solve, giving the rst non-trivial approximations to those as well.},

In doing so, we can reduce the amount of vehicles on surface streets and meantime save fuel. In this paper, we focus on the taxi-sharing service and propose a dynamic taxi-sharing system based on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technology. In the proposed system, we can immediately serve each irregular ride-sharing request and find a fuel-saving taxi for it. The simulation results show that our solution can exactly select a fuel-saving taxi for each ride-sharing request and outperform in responding time, the number of compared taxis, and fuel-saving while comparing with existing solutions.},

The regular routes were primarily short working trips within 60 minutes and 30 kilometers. The one-time routes presented dual characteristics of short business trips on weekdays and long homecoming trips on Friday and Saturday. Nearly three quarters of the members were not route posters but searchers. Over 73\% of the carpool members and route posters were private mode users, indicating that one carpool match would most likely combine two car/motorcycle trips instead of reducing transit rides. Carpool can effectively lessen on-road traffic and is concluded not to compete with but complement public transit. The carpool movement requires sustainable momentum and an integrated program with full policy support.},

  abstract = {In the dial-a-ride problem, users formulate requests for transportation from a specific origin to a specific destination. Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances.},

In SST, the rideshare clientele interact with the rideshare system using only WWW pages. SST collects spatial and temporal trip information using a series of WWW pages, performs a match using structured query language (SQL) specifications to a database engine, and supports both the standard phone-based contact methodology as well as two new, unique e-mail-based contact methodologies. SST was operated in parallel to a traditional, regional rideshare system for one year, and the two systems were marketed to the user community on a side-by-side basis. SST and the traditional system acquired approximately the same number of new users over a nine-month test period; however, there was little overlap in the population using the two parallel systems. SST demonstrates that there is a user population that can be reached using Internet technologies for immediate/dynamic ridematching that is not reached by traditional ridematch programs. This paper also reports a new statistical model for quantifying rideshare matching and carpooling. The model is validated using the SST experimental results, and the model demonstrates that the carpooling process is a quadratic function of the number of users participating.},

It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP's domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP's facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature.},

One of the unique features in the proposed framework is that the system is not limited to any particular type of vehicle. Thus, any type of vehicle such as car, bus or even lorry can be pooled using the proposed system. Moreover to ensure payment security, the system is designed as a prepaid system. Hence, rider has to ensure payment before getting into the ride, where the drive's account is credited once the rider reaches his/her destination.},

The side constraints are dualized to obtain a Lagrangian problem that provides lower bounds in a branch-and-bound algorithm.

  abstract = {Using a private car is a transportation system very common in industrialized countries. However, it causes different problems such as overuse of oil, traffic jams causing earth pollution, health problems and an inefficient use of personal time. One possible solution to these problems is carpooling, i.e. sharing a trip on a private car of a driver with one or more passengers. Carpooling would reduce the number of cars on streets hence providing worldwide environmental, economical and social benefits. The matching of drivers and passengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies. Typically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on his/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for trips and contact the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long trips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is not used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering this service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption. Dynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and increasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling impromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street and can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no dynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize such systems failed. This paper reviews the state of the art of dynamic carpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of dynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It proposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic carpooling systems.},

Formally, given a metric space on n vertices V, with m demand pairs {$\subseteq$} V \texttimes V and a ``target'' k {$\leq$} m, the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connects at least k demand pairs. In this paper, we give an {$\mathsl{O}$}(min\{{$\mathsl{n}\surd$},{$\mathsl{k}$}--{$\surd\rbrace$})O(min\{n,k\})O(\textbackslash min\textbackslash\{\textbackslash sqrt\{n\},\textbackslash sqrt\{k\}\textbackslash\})-approximation algorithm for k-forest, improving on the previous best ratio of {$\mathsl{O}$}(min\{{$\mathsl{n}$}2/3,{$\mathsl{m}$}--{$\surd\rbrace$}log{$\mathsl{n}$})O(min\{n2/3,m\}log⁡n)O(\textbackslash min\textbackslash\{n\^\{2/3\},\textbackslash sqrt\{m\}\textbackslash\}\textbackslash log n) by Segev and Segev [20].We then apply our algorithm for k-forest to obtain approximation algorithms for several Dial-a-Ride problems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the following: given an n point metric space with m objects each with its own source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carrying at most k objects at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each object from its source to destination. We prove that an {$\alpha$}-approximation algorithm for the k-forest problem implies an O({$\alpha\cdot$}log2 n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our results for k-forest, we get an {$\mathsl{O}$}(min\{{$\mathsl{n}\surd$},{$\mathsl{k}$}--{$\surd\rbrace\cdot$}log2{$\mathsl{n}$})O(min\{n,k\}{$\cdot$}log2⁡n)O(\textbackslash min\textbackslash\{\textbackslash sqrt\{n\},\textbackslash sqrt\{k\}\textbackslash\}\textbackslash cdot\textbackslash log\^2 n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for Dial-a-Ride was an {$\mathsl{O}$}({$\mathsl{k}$}--{$\surd$}log{$\mathsl{n}$})O(klog⁡n)O(\textbackslash sqrt\{k\}\textbackslash log n)-approximation by Charikar and Raghavachari [5]; our results give a different proof of a similar approximation guarantee\textemdash in fact, when the vehicle capacity k is large, we give a slight improvement on their results.The reduction from Dial-a-Ride to the k-forest problem is fairly robust, and allows us to obtain approximation algorithms (with the same guarantee) for the following generalizations: (i) Non-uniform Dial-a-Ride, where the cost of traversing each edge is an arbitrary non-decreasing function of the number of objects in the vehicle; and (ii) Weighted Dial-a-Ride, where demands are allowed to have different weights. The reduction is essential, as it is unclear how to extend the techniques of Charikar and Raghavachari to these Dial-a-Ride generalizations.\vphantom{\}\}\}}},

The ridematching problem with time windows in dynamic ridesharing considers matching drivers and riders with similar routes (with drivers detour flexibility) and time schedules on short notice. This problem is hard to solve. In this work, we model the ridematching problem with time windows in dynamic ridesharing as an optimization problem and propose a genetic algorithm to solve it. We consider minimizing the total travel distance and time of the drivers (vehicles) and the total travel time of the riders and maximizing the number of the matches. In addition, we provide datasets for the ridematching problem, derived from a real world travel survey for northeastern Illinois, to test the proposed algorithm. Experimentation results indicate that the idea of dynamic ridesharing is feasible and the proposed algorithm is able to solve the ridematching problem with time windows in reasonable time.},

It consists of increasing the occupancy rate of cars by reducing the empty seats in these vehicles effectively. In this paper, an advanced carpool system is described in detail and called the intelligent carpool system (ICS), which provides carpoolers the use of the carpool services via a smart handheld device anywhere and at any time. The carpool service agency in the ICS is integrated with the abundant geographical, traffic, and societal information and used to manage requests. For help in coordinating the ride matches via the carpool service agency, we apply the genetic algorithm to propose the genetic-based carpool route and matching algorithm (GCRMA) for this multiobjective optimization problem called the carpool service problem (CSP). The experimental section shows that the proposed GCRMA is compared with two single-point methods: the random-assignment hill climbing algorithm and the greedy-assignment hill climbing algorithm on real-world scenarios. Use of the GCRMA was proved to result in superior results involving the optimization objectives of CSP than other algorithms. Furthermore, our GCRMA operates with significantly a small amount of computational complexity to response the match results in the reasonable time, and the processing time is further reduced by the termination criteria of early stop.},

Ridesharing has the potential to solve many environmental, congestion, pollution, and energy problems. In this paper, we introduce the problem of large scale real-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks. Trip requests are dynamically matched to vehicles while trip waiting and service time constraints are satisfied. We first propose two scheduling algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm and an integer programing algorithm. However, these algorithms do not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the ridesharing problem. Thus, we propose kinetic tree algorithms which are better suited to efficient scheduling of dynamic requests and adjust routes on-the-fly. We perform experiments on a large Shanghai taxi dataset. Results show that the kinetic tree algorithms outperform other algorithms significantly.},

It is independent of the amount of the resource. The fairness index always lies between 0 and 1. This boundedness aids intuitive understanding of the fairness index. For example, a distribution algorithm with a fairness of 0.10 means that it is unfair to 90\% of the users. Also, the discrimination index can be defined as 1 - fairness index.},

  abstract = {Extended Abstract Policies to reduce GHG emissions from road transportation encompass a wide range of strategies (1\textendash 3). Common examples of the policies include high efficiency vehicles (4), travel demand management (flexible hours, teleworking) (3), shifting from personal car to public transport (3, 5), alternative fuels (hydrogen, electricity, biofuel) (4, 6), various types of taxation (toll road, parking charges) (7), reducing engine weight (8), zero-carbon alternatives (cycling and walking) (5, 7), and High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes (5, 7). All of the strategies for reducing emissions can be classified into three groups: Reduce (Reducing GHG emissions per passenger kilometer), Avoid (Avoiding unnecessary energy consumption and promote other modes of transportation), and Replace (replacing fossil fuels with low-emission alternative fuels) as described in (9). This study focuses on the contribution of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and carpooling to Avoid strategies, specifically exploring the role of HOV lanes in carpooling decisions and quantitatively evaluating the effects of carpooling on air pollutants and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions. HOV lane refers to any special lane designated for exclusive use by high-occupancy vehicles including carpools, vanpools and buses. These lanes can help mitigate GHG emissions by promoting carpooling (vehicles with two or more passengers), reducing the number of vehicles on roads, and relieving traffic congestion. In this study, we first develop a set of statistical models to investigate the impact of the HOV lanes and other potential factors on carpooling behavior in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Next, we estimate the average emission reduction that will occur as a result of carpooling in each state. The results of this analysis can help policymakers to optimize infrastructural investments by identifying locations that maximize the response of drivers to added HOV lane-kilometers. Current literature provided rather limited evidence on how potential factors such as HOV lanes can affect carpooling behavior and how carpooling can influence the rate of emissions from passenger cars. Moreover, macro-level datasets have not been used very often to model the carpooling propensity within the states and compare vehicular emissions across the states. Therefore it is the objective of this research to bridge the current gap by utilizing the existing macro-level data. Our analysis of carpooling propensity as a function of HOV lane availability aims to quantify the influence of multiple variables on carpooling rate in the states by developing a multiple regression model. We selected this approach as it provides a simple framework for investigating the relationship among a given set of variables. Potential factors influencing carpooling propensity can be classified into three main categories: infrastructural, cost-related, and socio-demographic factors. This paper explores 7 variables in these three categories that are assumed to affect carpooling behavior and employs several datasets to encompass these variables.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses a pickup and delivery problem with time window constraints, using two types of delivery resources, which allows for coordination. A heavy resource (in this case a van) may carry both delivery items and one or more units of the lighter resource (foot couriers) on its single- or multi-route assignment. Foot couriers can pick up and deliver items independently, or travel with a van on its outbound and/or return leg. Coordination between resources can save time and cut costs. The optimization of this type of coordinated logistics system has received scant coverage in the literature. The objective criterion is the total cost (i.e., the sum of fixed cost and travelling cost) of both heavy and light resources. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer program, assuming a reasonable coordination strategy. A two-stage heuristic is designed by employing both exact approaches and an ejection chain based on modifying the shortest path algorithm implemented in a dynamic network. The two-stage heuristic is compared with optimization models for an independent strategy and a partial coordination strategy on both local and simulated instances of up to 200 customers. Under certain conditions, the benefit of coordination is realized over the independent strategy in terms of lower average total cost and usage of heavy resource.},

  abstract = {This paper developed a cell-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) formulation that follows the ideal dynamic user optimal (DUO) principle. Through defining an appropriate gap function, we transformed a formulation based on the nonlinear complementarity problem to an equivalent mathematical program. To improve the accuracy of dynamic traffic modelling, this formulation encapsulates a network version of the cell transmission model (CTM). We set up four scenarios to evaluate the properties of this formulation, in the aspects of traffic dynamics, traffic interactions across multiple links, and the ideal DUO principle. This formulation produced outputs that are in agreement with what the results ought to be. Namely, the formulation is able to capture dynamic traffic phenomena, such as shock-waves, queue formation, and dissipation. Moreover, it is capable of capturing dynamic traffic interactions across multiple links. Both of these characteristics are inherent from the underlying traffic model adopted in this formulation. The results also demonstrate that this cell-based formulation follows the ideal DUO principle.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses one of the most challenging issues in designing an efficient and sustainable ridesharing service: ridesharing market design. We formulate it as a fair cost allocation problem through the lens of the cooperative game theory. A special property of the cooperative ridesharing game is that its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an optimization problem. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special attention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction in the system. Due to its computational intractability, we break the problem into a master-subproblem structure and two subproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We propose a coalition generation procedure to find the nucleolus and approximate nucleolus of the game. Experimental results showed that when the game has a non-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed only when it is necessary and the approximate procedure produces the actual nucleolus. And when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is close to the actual one. Regardless of the emptiness of the game, our algorithm needs to generate only a small fraction (1.6\%) of the total coalition constraints to compute the approximate nucleolus. The proposed model and results nicely fit systems operated by autonomous vehicles.},

The implementation of taxi carpooling mode can alleviate the problem in a certain extent. The objective of this study is to optimize the taxi carpooling path. Firstly, the taxi carpooling path optimization model with single objective and its extended model with multiple objectives are built respectively. Then, the single objective path optimization model of taxi carpooling is solved based on the improved single objective genetic algorithm, and the multiple-objective path optimization model of taxi carpooling is solved based on the improved multiple-objective genetic algorithm. Finally, a case study is carried out based on a road network with 24 nodes. The case study results show the path optimization models and algorithms of taxi carpooling proposed in the paper can quickly get the taxi carpooling path, and can increase the income of taxi driver while reduce the cost for passengers.},

  abstract = {We proposed and developed a taxi-sharing system that accepts taxi passengers' real-time ride requests sent from smart phones and schedules proper taxis to pick up them via ride sharing, subject to time, capacity, and monetary constraints. The monetary constraints provide incentives for both passengers and taxi drivers: passengers will not pay more compared with no ride sharing and get compensated if their travel time is lengthened due to ride sharing; taxi drivers will make money for all the detour distance due to ride sharing. While such a system is of significant social and environmental benefit, e.g., saving energy consumption and satisfying people's commute, real-time taxi-sharing has not been well studied yet. To this end, we devise a mobile-cloud architecture based taxi-sharing system. Taxi riders and taxi drivers use the taxi-sharing service provided by the system via a smart phone App. The Cloud first finds candidate taxis quickly for a taxi ride request using a taxi searching algorithm supported by a spatio-temporal index. A scheduling process is then performed in the cloud to select a taxi that satisfies the request with minimum increase in travel distance. We built an experimental platform using the GPS trajectories generated by over 33,000 taxis over a period of three months. A ride request generator is developed (available at http://cs.uic.edu/ sma/ridesharing) in terms of the stochastic process modelling real ride requests learned from the data set. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments, our proposed system demonstrated its efficiency, effectiveness and scalability. For example, when the ratio of the number of ride requests to the number of taxis is 6, our proposed system serves three times as many taxi riders as that when no ridesharing is performed while saving 11 percent in total travel distance and 7 percent taxi fare per rider.},

  abstract = {Ridesharing offers the opportunity to make more efficient use of vehicles while preserving the benefits of individual mobility. Presenting ridesharing as a viable option for commuters, however, requires minimizing certain inconvenience factors. One of these factors includes detours which result from picking up and dropping off additional passengers. This paper proposes a method which aims to best utilize ridesharing potential while keeping detours below a specific limit. The method specifically targets ridesharing systems on a very large scale and with a high degree of dynamics which are difficult to address using classical approaches known from operations research. For this purpose, the road network is divided into distinct partitions which define the search space for ride matches. The size and shape of the partitions depend on the topology of the road network as well as on two free parameters. This allows optimizing the partitioning with regard to sharing potential utilization and inconvenience minimization. Match making is ultimately performed using an agent-based approach. As a case study, the algorithm is applied to investigate the potential for taxi sharing in Singapore. This is done by considering about 110 000 daily trips and allowing up to two sharing partners. The outcome shows that the number of trips could be reduced by 42\% resulting in a daily mileage savings of 230 000 km. It is further shown that the presented approach exceeds the mileage savings achieved by a greedy heuristic by 6\% while requiring 30\% lower computational efforts.},

This paper introduces a novel two-stage machine learning approach for predicting workflow task execution times for varying input data in the cloud. In order to achieve high accuracy predictions, our approach relies on parameters reflecting runtime information and two stages of predictions. Empirical results for four real world workflow applications and several commercial cloud providers demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing prediction methods. In our experiments, our approach respectively achieves a best-case and worst-case estimation error of 1.6 and 12.2 percent, while existing methods achieved errors beyond 20 percent (for some cases even over 50 percent) in more than 75 percent of the evaluated workflow tasks. In addition, we show that the models predicted by our approach for a specific cloud can be ported with low effort to new clouds with low errors by requiring only a small number of executions.},

  abstract = {Lyft Line and UberPool offer travelers lower prices than personal ride-hailing service in exchange for the ability of drivers to serve other passengers during the ride. The rising popularity of these ridesplitting services raises questions about the potential diversion of traffic from urban transit services. To help answer those questions, this study explores travel time and fare differences between UberPool and traditional transit service on 50 paired trips, between 3 and 11 miles long, in Chicago, Illinois. UberPool is found to reduce trip times by an average of 67.6\% between neighborhoods, compared to just 13.7\% to and from the central business district. Multiple regression analysis shows travel times on CTA and UberPool are similar for trips in which transit riders do not need to make transfers or walk long distances. Consumers save \$1.29/minute when using UberPool on trips originating or terminating in the downtown district, compared to just \$.38/minute on trips between neighborhoods. In both cases, the amount spent per minute saved exceeds the level the U.S. Department of Transportation recommends using when conducting analysis about the value transit users place on saving time.},

In this way, the utilization of seats can be improved and the number of cars used can be reduced. Ridesharing has the potential to solve the problems of congestion, pollution, high travel cost, and energy. The development of internet, smart phone, GPS allows dynamic matchings of travel requests with available cars through real-time travel planning systems. However, matching requests and cars under certain constrains in large scale remains challenging. In this paper, we formally address the problem of dynamic ridesharing and introduce the solution framework of filter and refine, under which we summarize existing state-of-the-art works. Finally, we point out possible research directions and problems needed to be solved.},

  abstract = {Ride-sharing (RS) has great values in saving energy and alleviating traffic pressure. Existing studies can be improved for better efficiency. Therefore, we propose a new ride-sharing model, where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider, the shared route percentage (i.e., the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total travel distance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver, e.g., 0.8. We consider two variants of this problem. The first considers multiple drivers and multiple riders and aims to compute driver-rider pairs to maximize the overall shared route percentage (SRP). We model this problem as the maximum weighted bigraph matching problem, where the vertices are drivers and riders, edges are driver-rider pairs, and edge weights are driver-rider's SRP. However, it is rather expensive to compute the SRP values for large numbers of driver-rider pairs on road networks. To address this problem, we propose an efficient method to prune many unnecessary driver-rider pairs and avoid computing the SRP values for every pair. To improve the efficiency, we propose an approximate method with error bound guarantee. The basic idea is that we compute an upper bound and a lower bound for each driver-rider pair in constant time. Then, we estimate an upper bound and a lower bound of the graph matching. Next, we select some driver-rider pairs, compute their real shortest-route distance, and update the lower and upper bounds of the maximum graph matching. We repeat above steps until the ratio of the upper bound to the lower bound is not larger than a given approximate rate. The second considers multiple drivers and a single rider and aims to find the top-\$k\$ drivers for the rider with the largest SRP. We first prune a large number of drivers that cannot meet the SRP requirements. Then, we propose a best-first algorithm that progressively selects the drivers with high probability to be in the top- \$k\$ results and prunes the drivers that cannot be in the top- \$k\$ results. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract = {Car pooling is one method that can be easily instituted and can help to resolve a variety of problems that continue to plague urban areas, ranging from energy demands and traffic congestion to environmental pollution. Although car pooling is becoming more common, in practice, participant matching results are still being obtained by an inefficient manual approach, which may possibly result in an inferior solution. In the past, when car pooling studies have been done the problem has been treated as either a to-work problem (from different origins to the same destination) or return-from-work problem (from the same origin to different destinations). However, in this study we employ a time-space network flow technique to develop a model for the many-to-many car pooling problem with multiple vehicle types and person types. The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. Since real problem sizes can be huge, it could be difficult to find optimal solutions within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we develop a solution algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation, a subgradient method, and a heuristic for the upper bound solution, to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm can be applied to real world, we randomly generated several examples based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan, on which we performed numerical tests. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm.},

These research efforts have resulted in a number of different algorithms and a considerable amount of empirical findings with respect to performance. Unfortunately, prior research does not provide a clear direction for choosing an algorithm when one faces the problem of computing shortest paths on real road networks. Most of the computational testing on shortest path algorithms has been based on randomly generated networks, which may not have the characteristics of real road networks. In this paper, we provide an objective evaluation of 15 shortest path algorithms using a variety of real road networks. Based on the evaluation, a set of recommended algorithms for computing shortest paths on real road networks is identified. This evaluation should be particularly useful to researchers and practitioners in operations research, management science, transportation, and Geographic Information Systems.},

  abstract = {Carpooling taxicab services hold the promise of providing additional transportation supply, especially in the extreme weather or rush hour when regular taxicab services are insufficient. Although many recommendation systems about regular taxicab services have been proposed recently, little research, if any, has been done to assist passengers to find a successful taxicab ride with carpooling. In this paper, we present the first systematic work to design a unified recommendation system for both the regular and carpooling services, called CallCab, based on a data-driven approach. In response to a passenger's real-time request, CallCab aims to recommend either: 1) a vacant taxicab for a regular service with no detour or 2) an occupied taxicab heading to the similar direction for a carpooling service with the minimum detour, yet without assuming any knowledge of destinations of passengers already in taxicabs. To analyze these unknown destinations of occupied taxicabs, CallCab generates and refines taxicab trip distributions based on GPS data sets and context information collected in the existing taxicab infrastructure. To improve CallCab's efficiency to process such a big data set, we augment the efficient MapReduce model with a Measure phase tailored for our CallCab. Finally, we design a reciprocal price mechanism to facilitate the taxicab carpooling implementation in the real world. We evaluate CallCab with a real-world data set of 14000 taxicabs, and results show that compared with the ground truth, CallCab reduces 60\% of the total mileage to deliver all passengers and 41\% of passenger's waiting time. Our price mechanism reduces 23\% of passengers' fares and increases 28\% of drivers' profits simultaneously.},

The results show that passenger's complaint mechanism can effectively decrease the phenomenon of driver refusing passengers with carpooling detour. When probability of passenger complaint reaches a certain level, the stable strategy of driver is to take carpooling detour passengers. Meanwhile, limiting detour distance and easing traffic congestion can decrease the possibility of refusing passengers.
