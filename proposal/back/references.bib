	abstract = {Ridesharing, which offers empty seats in a car to other passengers, is an efficient way of transportation. In this way, the utilization of seats can be improved and the number of cars used can be reduced. Ridesharing has the potential to solve the problems of congestion, pollution, high travel cost, and energy. The development of internet, smart phone, {GPS} allows dynamic matchings of travel requests with available cars through real-time travel planning systems. However, matching requests and cars under certain constrains in large scale remains challenging. In this paper, we formally address the problem of dynamic ridesharing and introduce the solution framework of filter and refine, under which we summarize existing state-of-the-art works. Finally, we point out possible research directions and problems needed to be solved.},

	abstract = {Since the late 1990s, numerous ridematching programmes have integrated the Internet, mobile phones, and social networking into their services. Online ridematching systems are employing a range of new strategies to create “critical mass”: (1) regional and large employer partnerships, (2) ﬁnancial incentives, (3) social networking to younger populations, and (4) real-time ridematching services that employ “smartphones” and automated ridematching software. Enhanced casual carpooling approaches, which focus on “meeting places”, are also being explored. Today, ridesharing represents approximately 8– 11\% of the transportation modal share in Canada and the {USA}, respectively. There are approximately 638 ridematching programmes in North America. Ridesharing’s evolution can be categorized into ﬁve phases: (1) World War {II} car-sharing (or carpooling) clubs; (2) major responses to the 1970s energy crises; (3) early organized ridesharing schemes; (4) reliable ridesharing systems; and (5) technology-enabled ridematching. While ridesharing’s future growth and direction are uncertain, the next decade is likely to include greater interoperability among services, technology integration, and stronger policy support. In light of growing concerns about climate change, congestion, and oil dependency, more research is needed to better understand ridesharing’s impacts on infrastructure, congestion, and energy/emissions.},
